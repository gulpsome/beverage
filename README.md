# beverage -- give it a gulp

Because even with [gulp-npm-run](https://github.com/orlin/gulp-npm-run)
and [gulp-npm-test](https://github.com/orlin/gulp-npm-test)
I'd still do a lot of copy-pasting between gulpfiles.

There is almost always `test` + `test:watch`,
and often some kind of `build` + `build:watch` tasks.
