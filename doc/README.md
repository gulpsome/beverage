# Beverage diagram

Here is the rationale / legend of the diagram:

- the text names node modules - found [via npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
- the modules offered through beverage point with green arrows to `be-goods`
- the modules whose names are colored in red use beverage themselves
- the modules having purple frames are tested with `gulp-npm-test` beverage
- the thinner-framed `sourcegate` & `childish-process` are tested with `gulp-npm-run`
- `batshit` (`bats`) is used for testing `gulp-npm-run` and `gulp-npm-test`
